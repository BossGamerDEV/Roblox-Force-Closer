I have created these scripts to fix a roblox player bug.

The bug is when you close the game but it is still running in the background.

To fix it just run the script (Should be the BETA one) and it should exit instantly.

This is a very easy to fix just by doing this.

**Run this to close Roblox instead until the run in background bug is fixed.**
